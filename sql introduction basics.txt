Aliasing:-
________
name is there we can want short cut name we can use the aliasling.
student
_______
id          empname      sala
             _______      _______
_______
1001          vishnu        20000
10002          saif         3000
1003           reddy        40000
  
  select empname,sal from student;  _>normal query
  select empname AS "empnam_name", sal AS "salary" from student; -> aliasling query.
  "emp name" -> space is there we can use the double contation.
"SalARY" we have upper and lowwer case we can use the double contation.



Literals.
_________  
  where name ='vishnu' -> character Literals. single contation
  where sal 10000-> number Literals
  where date = '01-JUNE-2023' date Literals
  
  
  concat
  _____.
  concat means two string are combined;
  select 'hello'||'world' from student.  _> output is helloworld   ||_> this symbol is use to oracle
  'vishnu'+'reddy'_>reddy __> this symbol is use to squl only.
  we can number also 1+2  _>12 output
  
  
  Operators
  _________>
  Arithmetic Operators
  ____________________
  *,+,-,/
  Retional Operators
  ____________________
  <, >, <=,>=,<>-> not equal ,!=,+

  
  Logical Operators
  ____________________
  AND , OR , NOT
  AND -> both condition are satified then give the output true are false get only one 
  select * from emp where ename='vishnu' AND salary >75000;
  OR-> one condition is satified then give the output and both output will be com
  select * from emp where ename='vishnu' OR salary >75000;
  NOT->  both condition are false then output will be cam false both contation are true output will be not cam
  i NOT NULL
          
  
  Special Operators
  _________
  between and , is null ,in ,like
  between-> between to condition select * from where emp='vishnu' OR salary between 60000 and 70000.
  is null -> where name is null select * from where ename is NULL; manager name is null.
  in -> in means between condition select * from where ename in ('vishnu','reddy');
                                                        salary in (60000,70000);
   like-> like means in charater starting litter 'G%' starting '%G' and '%L--' staring , '--L%' ending   
   
   
   
   Function in sql
   _______________ 
   they are two of the Function 
   1.multi row this is excuted multi row only in multi row 
   they are six types are there 
   (group Function) group by means excuted by group elements only 
   ->max() 
   ->min() 
   ->avg() 
   ->sum() 
   ->count() 
   2. single row
   ______________ 
   in single row six types are there sinle row
   this is excuted single row by row only 
   ->length(len) 
   -> show the length of string 
   ->uppercase -> lowercase are in uppercase 
   ->lowercase-> uppercase are in lowercase 
   ->concat-> two string are concat
   ->initcap-> vishnu is there V has capital reaming are small that is called initcap 
   ->nested Function-> LEN(upper(lower(hi))) this is possible output is LEN(upper(hi)) LEN(lower(hi)) LEN=2 upper(LEN(vishnu))-> this not possible because len is interger is there these we not possible len(upper(vishnu))-> this is possible ouput is 6
